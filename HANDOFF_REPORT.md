# Project Overview
## üéØ Frontend Build Report ‚Äì PawaShare
- **Objective**: Build a production-ready frontend for PawaShare.
- **Current Deployment**: https://pawashare-frontend.vercel.app/

## üèóÔ∏è Development Approach

### 1. UI Development with [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/) - [Go to repository](https://github.com/Althub-Team17/pawashare-frontend)
- Wrote detailed prompts to describe each section from design team figma/mockup and used v0.dev AI-powered UI builder to scaffold initial React components    (insert link to v0.dev)
```markdown
Create a responsive hero section for a clean energy platform called "PawaShare" using React and Tailwind CSS. The section should feature a full-width background image of solar panels with a semi-transparent dark overlay.

Inside the overlay, add:
- A large, bold headline: "Share Solar Energy with Your Community"
- A smaller subheading: "Connect with neighbors, reduce your carbon footprint, and save money by sharing excess solar energy through our platform."
- Two call-to-action buttons:
    - Primary: "Get Started" (green background, white text)
    - Secondary: "Learn More" (white border, transparent background, green text)

Layout:
- Left-aligned content on desktop, center-aligned on mobile
- Use Tailwind spacing utilities for proper padding/margin
- Ensure all text is readable over the background using an overlay or text shadow
- Buttons should be vertically stacked on small screens and side-by-side on medium and above

Accessibility:
- Use semantic HTML (section, h1, p, button)
- Add alt text or aria-labels where appropriate

Styling:
- Use Tailwind CSS classes
- Colors should follow a clean energy theme (green highlights, white or light-gray text)
- The section should be mobile-first and fully responsive
```
